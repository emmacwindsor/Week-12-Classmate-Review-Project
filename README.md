Week 12 Changes

So for the last assignment, I was so blown away by everyone's project!! They all looked so great! 

I decided to choose Jessica Standage's project to just improve one thing I thought I could help!! I loved the layout of her webpage for her family band, but I felt like the song list got a little lost in the picture. So I added a table for the song list to make it a bit more clear. It may not be the best stlye wise but I beleive it makes it a lot clealer and able to see te track names better.
