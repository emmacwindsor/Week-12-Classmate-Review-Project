List of known bugs and/or issues:

Under 'Contact Us', when you press 'submit', yes it takes you to the Mail page, which then allows you to directly email us...But, when you return to our Webpage, you'll find your message still there. It remains there until you have either erased the text, or else reloaded the page. Perhaps find a way to fix this, so that way the message will erase once one has sent their email.

TODO:

Find a way to make one of our audio tracks to play automatically when a visitor loads the webpage.
